    "Q4 sales $1.85B (+2.9%) slightly above consensus; adjusted EPS 86¢ missed consensus 88¢",
    "FY26 guidance $3.05–$3.13 vs Street ~$3.21; management cites tariffs and elevated input costs"

  "mechanism": "Tariffs and input-cost inflation raise COGS and compress gross margin; if pricing and productivity gains do not fully offset, earnings guidance falls and the stock reprices immediately.",
  "base_case": "Volume holds modestly, pricing benefits continue, enabling low-single-digit organic sales growth (1–3%) while cost actions partially offset tariffs/inflation; earnings land within guided range.",
  "tail_risk": "Tariffs or trade costs re-accelerate and/or input inflation persists while pricing power fades, causing further margin compression, another guidance reset, and broader read-through to packaged-food profitability.",
  "action": "Prepare/Monitor",
  "action_triggers": [
    "Track tariff/trade policy developments and company commentary on cost absorption vs pass-through",
